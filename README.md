Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger in the designated section of the page -- waiting to be devoured or already eaten.

Each burger in the waiting area also has a 'Eat-da-Burger' button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the 'Burgers that have been devoured!' section of the page.

The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.

Built with Node, Javascript, Express-Handlebars, and mySQL.
